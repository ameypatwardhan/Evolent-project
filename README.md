# Evolent-project

Hi Evolent team,

As discussed with you i have created the project named "evolent-jpa-crud-example" in GitHUb at URL https://github.com/ameypatwardhan/Evolent-project.git 

I have created this project with following techniologies

BACKEND SIDE
1)Rest-API spring boot
2)JPA repository
3)Mysql-Database 

I have used thymeleaf of springboot to create fronend for the application. Those files are present in the templates folder of the resources folder

This project will do add/edit/delete/list functionality as you mentioned in the document.

To run this application you will need to deploy the application on machine locally. Also ensure that you have mysql instance running on the machine.

afterthat exicuting localhost:8080 on the browser you will navigate through application.

Since i do not have git bash in localmachine, i have uploaded the project as file upload mechanism in the GIT HUB.

Please let me know in case you need any more details
